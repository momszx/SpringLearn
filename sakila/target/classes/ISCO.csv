1635901,1,10,,,,"CONCEPT: The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) is an international classification managed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It is a revision of the ISCO-88, which it supersedes. ISCO-08 is a tool for organizing jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. ISCO-08 has been developed to facilitate international comparisons of occupational statistics and to serve as a model for countries developing or revising their national occupational classifications. The framework used for the design and construction of ISCO-08 is based on two main concepts: the concept of job, and the concept of skill. A job is defined in ISCO-08 as “a set of tasks and duties performed, or meant to be performed, by one person, including for an employer or in self-employment”. Occupation refers to the kind of work performed in a job. The concept of occupation is defined as a “set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterized by a high degree of similarity”. A person may be associated with an occupation through the main job currently held, a second job, a future job or a job previously held. Skill is defined as the ability to carry out the tasks and duties of a given job. For the purposes of ISCO-08, two dimensions of skills are used to arrange occupations into two groups: (a) Skill level is defined as a function of the complexity and range of tasks and duties to be performed in an occupation and (b) skill specialization is considered in terms of four concepts: the field of knowledge required, the tools and machinery used, the materials worked on or with and the kinds of goods and services produced.",
